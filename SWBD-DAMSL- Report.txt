Assignment 3 Report

Name: Vivek Tiwari

1. If you included files other than baseline_crf.py, advanced_crf.py, evaluate_model.py, and hw3_corpus_tool.py, or modified hw3_corpus_tool.py please describe what the files do and/or your modifications to hw3_corpus_tool.py.

I have submitted 3 files in all:
	a. baseline_crf.py
	b. advanced_crf.py
	c. SWBD-DAMSL-Report.txt

In both the file that is baseline_crf.py and advanced_crf.py i have used the same code provided by TA to read the contents of the CSV file.I have’t modified any of the content of the hw3_corpus_tool.py.

I have create evaluate_model.py functionality at the end of both the files(baseline_crf.py and advanced_crf.py). I have commented the code while submitting.




2. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features

The baseline model is trained using the features which are mentioned in the assignment that is (Beginning of the CSV file, Speaker changed , Tokens and Part of speech )

Advanced model is evaluated taking additional features like bigram and trigram into consideration.

I generally divided data into two parts “Train Set” and “Test Set”. Train set consist of 75% of data whereas Test Set consist of 25% of data.


3. Describe your advanced feature set.

For my advanced set , i am using bi-gram and tri-gram as features. In case of bi-gram i am choosing current and the next word, whereas in case of trigram i am using previous, current and the next word as a feature

4. If you tried alternate advanced feature sets, please describe them.

5. Accuracy of baseline features was: 72.29140722291407  ( 150 Iterations )
6. Accuracy of advanced features was: 73.51338729763387	 ( 50 Iterations )
